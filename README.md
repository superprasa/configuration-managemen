# configuration-managemen
configuration management library, written in C++. It’s designed to manage key-value pairs (variables) within a configuration file.
This code appears to be part of a configuration management library, written in C++. It’s designed to manage key-value pairs (variables) within a configuration file, allowing a developer to dynamically create, load, modify, and save configuration settings. This functionality is useful in real-time applications for several reasons:

Dynamic Configuration Loading:

The code can read configuration data from files, which can be helpful when settings need to be updated without recompiling the program. For example, in real-time systems where parameters (like timeouts, thresholds, or feature flags) might need to change based on environment conditions or operator input.
Error Handling and Logging:

The error_msg vector and getError function provide predefined error messages and help keep track of errors in configuration loading or saving, which is important for debugging and stability in real-time applications.
Real-time systems often need to run continuously, and these error checks can ensure the system logs any configuration issues without crashing.
Customizable Parameters for Real-Time Processes:

Real-time applications often rely on configurations to define operation parameters, like processing thresholds, communication protocols, or data logging levels. This configuration code allows parameters to be stored in a file, enabling changes at runtime.
Efficient Data Storage and Retrieval:

The library uses a vector to store configuration variables in memory, which provides fast access when parameters need to be read or updated frequently in real-time applications. By offering functions like replaceVariable, _delete_list_element, and clearConfig, it allows quick modification of parameters, which is useful in adaptive real-time systems.
Separating Code and Configuration:

With this library, configuration is managed separately from the application’s main logic, making it easier to maintain and adjust the parameters without modifying code. In real-time embedded systems, this separation can simplify updates and help with code portability.
Configuration File Writing and Reading:

The dumpConfig and loadConfig functions let the library save the current configuration state to a file and read it back later. In real-time applications, saving states at intervals can be useful for recovery if the system is restarted or reset.
Debugging and Safety:

The use of conditional compilation with #if defined DEBUG for warning functions allows the code to output warning messages during development without affecting performance in production.
